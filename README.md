<img src="public/images/todolist.png">

## Project Description

- The goal of this project is to create a ToDo List web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view tasks. Tasks will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application. Styling will be an important aspect of this project to ensure a good user experience.

## Features

1. Task Creation: Users should be able to create new tasks.

2. Task Viewing: Users should be able to view a list of all their tasks.

3. Task Completion: Users should be able to strike through their completed tasks in the todo list. Tasks do not need to be deleted.
